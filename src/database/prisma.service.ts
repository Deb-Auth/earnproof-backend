  /**
   * Makes every `auditLog.create(...)` call transparently participate in the
   * per-chain tamper-evidence hash chain, regardless of which service issued
   * it.
   *
   * Why an instance patch instead of `$extends`: a Prisma Client Extension
   * (`this.$extends(...)`) returns a *new* client object with an extended
   * type; it does not mutate `this` in place. Every service in this codebase
   * injects and type-annotates `PrismaService` (the class this constructor
   * belongs to), including lifecycle methods (`onModuleInit`/
   * `onModuleDestroy`) that a bare `$extends(...)` result does not have, so
   * swapping in an extended client would require re-typing every injection
   * site. Overriding the `auditLog.create` method on the already-constructed
   * delegate keeps the same `PrismaService` type and DI token everywhere,
   * while still intercepting every call site transparently — including the
   * existing ones in api-keys, organizations, issuers, payments,
   * trusted-sources and webhooks, none of which need to change.
   *
   * Concurrency: appends to the same chain (same `chainKey`) are made safe
   * with a Postgres row lock. Each call opens its own `$transaction`,
   * `SELECT ... FOR UPDATE`s the chain's `AuditChainCursor` row (inserting it
   * first via `INSERT ... ON CONFLICT DO NOTHING` if this is the chain's
   * first record), computes the next `sequence`/`hash` from the locked
   * cursor, inserts the audit row, and advances the cursor — all before the
   * lock is released at commit. A pessimistic lock (rather than an optimistic
   * compare-and-swap retry loop) was chosen because audit writes are already
   * wrapped one-at-a-time per call and are not expected to be a high-throughput
   * hot path; a short-lived row lock is simpler to reason about here than a
   * retry loop and cannot livelock under contention.
